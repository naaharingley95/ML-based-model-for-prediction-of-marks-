## üìà Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a simple yet fundamental machine learning model to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied. It utilizes a Linear Regression algorithm from the Scikit-learn library.

The entire workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation and visualization, is contained within the Jupyter Notebook ML model prediction of marks.ipynb.

## üìä Results and Visualization
The model learns the linear relationship between the hours studied and the score achieved. The scatter plot below shows the actual data points, while the red line represents the predictions made by our trained model.

Model Performance
Predictions on Test Data: For the given test set, the model predicted scores of [81.63, 22.37].

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The model achieved an MSE of 4.78. This metric indicates the average squared difference between the actual scores and the predicted scores, with a lower value signifying a better fit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The project follows these key steps:

Data Preparation: A small, sample dataset is created using a Pandas DataFrame, containing two columns: Hours_Studied and Score.

Feature Selection: Hours_Studied is selected as the independent variable (feature, X), and Score is the dependent variable (target, y).

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using train_test_split. This allows us to train the model on one subset of the data and evaluate its performance on another, unseen subset.

Model Training: A LinearRegression model is instantiated and trained using the .fit() method on the training data (X_train and y_train).

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set (X_test).

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated by calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted values (y_pred) and the actual values (y_test).

Visualization: Matplotlib is used to create a scatter plot of the actual data and overlay the linear regression line to visually assess the model's fit.
